# Crowdfunding-ETL
Overview

The purpose of this module was to write SQL queries to perform on behalf of Independent Funding, the crowfunding used for funding independent projects or ventures.  They want us to migrate their data from Excel files into a PostgreSQL database.  After migration, we performed further analysis on the backers info. This includes reports for company stakeholders and individuals who donate to projects. 

Summary

 We used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook to extract and transform a large Excel file into smaller CSV files.  Then, we created a PostgreSQL database and tables by using an ERD as our guide. After that we loaded the CSV files into a database and ran queries to retrieve data and generate reports for stakeholders.
